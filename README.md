# Java-Object-Database
Java serialized Object Database
This JODB package is a Java Object Database where the objects are usually Java serialized objects.

NOTE: The EnDecrypt API is only secure if you and only you know the encryption/decryption algorithm, so I leave this API empty and only provide you with the EnDecrypt.class if you want to use my EnDecrypt algorithm for your JODB.
